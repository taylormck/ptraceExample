Project 1. CS439 (Rockhold)

Name1: Taylor McKinney EID1: tsm544  Slip days I used (this project): 0 Slip days used (total): 0

Public CS Linux machine your solution successfully runs on:  _________.cs.utexas.edu

Does it run on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines (e.g. nikon (64) and chastity (32))? ________

What system call did you choose to use?:
getpid()
number 39 on my home computer


Explain why it was a good choice:
Neither worker nor ls (used for testing) calls getpid such that they need the original return value,
so changing the return value will not interrupt ls's normal operation, and can be used for worker

List all the syscall numbers that were issued during the execution along with their syscall "name":
